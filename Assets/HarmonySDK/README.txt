Harmony Game Engine Export
CopyrightÂ© 2016 Toon Boom Animation Inc.
==========================

The Harmony Game Engine feature proposes a clean data structure to
render sprite sheet based animated characters in a wide range of
devices.  The Drawing and the animation is done in Harmony and
exported to an xml data structure that can be then used in multiple
game engines through our plugins.

Basic Guideline for Harmony
---------------------------

While using Harmony, the user must avoid using rendering effects in
his animation or complex composition in the network.

During export, the order in which layers will be sorted is dependant on
the order of layers in the timeline and their z offset.  So, depending
on its network composition, the user might have to reorder its layers on
the z axis to get the proper result.

As for effects, they cannot be used currently.  The sprite sheets used in
the game engine are rendered using the initial drawing saved on disk
(i.e. tvg file).  The effects cannot be currently generated dynamically
through the game engine itself.  If the user needs an effect to be visible,
then this effect will have to be backed in the drawing.

To generate several animation sequences of a same character, it is
suggested to make use of the versioning capability of Harmony.  As long
as a character maintains the same hierarchy (i.e. the same timeline
composition in Harmony), it will reuse the same skeleton in the game
engine and share its drawings in the sprite sheet.

Data Structure
--------------

The exported data structure contains the following files and folders:

  XmlExport/
    +- stage.xml
    +- animation.xml
    +- skeleton.xml
    +- drawingAnimation.xml
    +- spriteSheets.xml
    +- spriteSheets/
       +- (...)
    +- audio/
       +- (...)
    +- stages/
       +- (...)

the stage.xml file is the main entry point for all animation.  It maps
all versions of the user Harmony scenes (e.g. walk cycle, run cycle...)
to a stage clip with their respective skeleton (skeleton.xml), animation
(animations.xml) and drawing animation (drawingAnimations.xml).  It also
schedules audio events for every stage clip if available.

A second more optimized level of the data structure is also available.
The binary format is the actual data structure used during rendering and
can be streamed in and out with ease.  For a stage clip containing one
or more animation, a single binary file is generated.  Only the binary
format can be kept at export if needed.  If so, the files skeleton.xml,
animation.xml and drawingAnimation.xml can be removed.
